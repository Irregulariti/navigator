# wifi_scanner

Wifi scanner Android(Kotlin)

I use it for a navigator 
that will work with wifi signal strength

Signal strength and BSSD
are saved to a file with a 
label from the TextField

val myIntent = Intent(Settings.ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS)
startActivity(myIntent)
used to give location permission.
1) uncomment it and give permission to 
the "navigator" application.
2) comment out the line and 
restart the application.
